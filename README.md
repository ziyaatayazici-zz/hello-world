# hello-world
A huge first step to GitHub!

Hi there! You know, I'm just tryig to configure what is GitHub and how is it working. Let me introduce myself to you a little bit. I am an undergraduate student in TOBB ETU, Turkey. Doing my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering. I have a huge interest to computer programming, robotics, medical devices and so on... So, pretend like it is a normal conversation.

See you in the compiler!
